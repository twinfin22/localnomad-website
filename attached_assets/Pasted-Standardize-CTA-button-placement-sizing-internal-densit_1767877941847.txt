Standardize CTA button placement, sizing, internal density, and color contrast across all sections (especially “Choose Your Landing” and “What’s Next”).

Problems to fix
	•	CTA buttons are vertically misaligned between cards.
	•	CTA placement varies by section, causing visual inconsistency.
	•	Button text feels too loose with excessive internal padding (especially in “What’s Next”).
	•	Secondary CTAs rely on dimmed backgrounds, which looks dull and unintentional.

Goals

Create a consistent CTA system where:
	•	CTA buttons align visually across cards.
	•	Button text feels dense, intentional, and balanced.
	•	Primary vs Secondary CTAs are differentiated by color and structure, not dimming.

⸻

1) CTA placement (layout rule)
	•	In all card-based sections (pricing, choose your landing, what’s next):
	•	CTA buttons must be anchored to the bottom of each card.
	•	Use a flex column layout with mt-auto on the CTA container.
	•	All CTAs within the same row must sit on the same visual baseline.

2) Button sizing & internal density
	•	Increase text presence inside buttons:
	•	Use slightly larger text (text-base or text-lg consistently).
	•	Reduce excessive vertical padding.
	•	Buttons should feel “filled”, not airy:
	•	Prefer py-3 px-6 (or similar) instead of very tall padding.
	•	Text should sit comfortably without large empty zones above/below.

3) CTA width & consistency
	•	Within the same section:
	•	All CTAs should have the same width (e.g., full width of card footer).
	•	Avoid mixed button sizes in the same visual group.

⸻

4) Color & contrast system (IMPORTANT)

Do NOT use dimmed backgrounds for secondary CTAs.

Use a clear color system instead:
	•	Primary CTA:
	•	Background: Brand Navy #0B1F3B
	•	Text: White
	•	Secondary CTA:
	•	Background: Brand Secondary Blue (define one, e.g. #3F5F8C)
	•	Text: White
	•	No opacity dimming
	•	Tertiary / Outline (if needed):
	•	Transparent background
	•	Border in brand navy
	•	Text in brand navy

All CTA variants must:
	•	Work in both light and dark mode.
	•	Use theme-aware tokens (no hardcoded dim opacity tricks).

⸻

5) Section-specific fixes
	•	Choose Your Landing
	•	All pricing cards:
	•	CTA buttons aligned at bottom
	•	Same height and width
	•	What’s Next
	•	Reduce internal padding of CTA buttons
	•	Increase text size slightly
	•	Replace dimmed CTA background with the defined secondary brand color
	•	Ensure buttons feel like “actions”, not muted placeholders

⸻

6) Implementation notes
	•	Use the shared Button component and variants.
	•	Avoid one-off button styles per section.
	•	Update layout in the relevant section components.

⸻

Deliverables
	•	CTA buttons aligned across cards.
	•	Denser, more confident button text appearance.
	•	Clean primary/secondary contrast using color, not dimming.
	•	Confirm consistency across:
	•	Desktop + Mobile
	•	Light mode + Dark mode

Global consistency requirement (MANDATORY):
	•	Apply changes consistently across Desktop AND Mobile, Light AND Dark modes.
	•	Fix any discrepancies before finalizing.

Proceed to implement.
